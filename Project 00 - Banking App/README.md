# Project 00: Banking System

This is a relatively simple application that allows a user to access a mock 
bank account stored on a database. Through a CLI, a user can create accounts, 
and manage the funds of the accounts. 

This was a beginning project, to get our feet wet so to speak. 

I used the following technologies in the stack: 
* Java
* JDBC
* SQL
* RDS
* Maven
