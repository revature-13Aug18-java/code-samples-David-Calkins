# Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing 
employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the 
company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past 
tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all 
reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. 
Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense 
reimbursement.

One of the things I learned from this project was how to how to manage client 
requests. I worked heavily on the controllers between the front end 
and the database end. Part of this process involved numerous cases to handle 
specific error cases in order to provide meaningful error codes to the client. 

I used the following technologies in the stack: 
* Servlets
* Java
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* JDBC
* SQL
* AJAX
* Bootstrap
* RDS
* Tomcat
* Git
* Maven
