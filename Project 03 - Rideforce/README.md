# Project 03: RideForce

RideForce, previously RideShare, is a ride coordinating application for Revature 
Associates. All associates can create an account on the first day of training 
with a temporary access token generated by the app upon request of the trainer. 
A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. Any 
associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have registered cars 
based on proximity and preference.


My task primarily focused on researching and implementing new technologies into 
the matching microservice. I also worked on adding fallback implementation by 
utilizing Hystrix with Feign client.
