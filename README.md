#Code Sample Repository

The following repository contains several projects and parts of projects that 
I have worked on during my time at Revature. Below are very brief summaries of 
each project. 


# Project 0: Banking System

This is the first project I worked on in the early weeks of Revature. 
It is a simple banking application that allows users to perform basic bank transactions. 

# Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System

This if a full stack application that allows managers of a company to approve 
or deny reimbursement requests made by employees. 

# Project 2: Hero Directory

This is an application that allows users to create and battle teams of heroes
that they assemble. This was worked on by a small team. 

# Project 3: RideForce

The RideForce applcation facilitates scheduling and communication and between 
drivers and potential riders.
